There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.


public class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {

        int gasLeftInTank = gas[0] - cost[0];
        int startIndex = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < cost.length * 2; i++) {
            int k = i % cost.length;
            
            if (k == startIndex && gasLeftInTank >= 0) {
                 return k;
            }
            
            if (gasLeftInTank < 0) {
                gasLeftInTank = 0;
                startIndex = k;
            }
            
            gasLeftInTank += gas[k] - cost[k];
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
